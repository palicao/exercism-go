# Triangle

Write a program that can tell you if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

The program should raise an error if the triangle cannot exist.

## Hint

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the
length of the third side, a principle known as the _triangle
inequality_.

To run the tests simply run the command `go test` in the exercise directory.

If the test suite contains benchmarks, you can run these with the `-bench`
flag:

    go test -bench .

For more detailed info about the Go track see the [help
page](http://exercism.io/languages/go).
